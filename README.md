# Customer Churn Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project explores the **Customer Churn dataset** with a focus on applying core data science techniques. The aim was to understand customer behavior, identify potential churn drivers, and practice building predictive models. The workflow integrates **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **visualization**, **hypothesis testing**, and **machine learning modeling**.  

## Steps Taken  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.  
  - Examined distributions, correlations, and missing values.  
  - Identified key variables influencing churn such as tenure, contract type, and monthly charges.  

- **Visualization:**  
  - Created plots (histograms, boxplots, bar charts) to highlight churn patterns.  
  - Used heatmaps to visualize correlations between numerical features.  
  - Compared churn vs. non‑churn groups to uncover behavioral differences.  

- **Hypothesis Testing:**  
  - Applied statistical tests to validate assumptions about customer segments.  
  - Tested whether churn rates significantly differed across categories (e.g., contract type, payment method).  
  - Strengthened reasoning by linking statistical evidence with observed patterns.  

- **Modeling with Linear Regression:**  
  - Practiced building a regression model to predict churn probability.  
  - Split data into training and testing sets to evaluate performance.  
  - Generated predictions and assessed accuracy, noting limitations of linear regression for classification tasks.
